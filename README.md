# Eskinder-Fitsum-Project-2

## Project #2

- For this project, you will add CSS to the 3-page website you built for project 1.

- Deliverables & Milestones (see calender for due dates)

- First Deliverable: Use your Project One directory in Github to create a Project Two directory. You can branch it or create a new empty repostory and just copy and past your project 1 code. If you want to learn branching, seek help videos online. Create a new Basecamp post under "Project Two" with a link to your new directory. Your post should include:

- The URL to your Project 2 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages live link

- Six screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for each website page (Use the live link to validate).

- Two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students

- Second Deliverable: Give constructive comments to help at least three other students. Post a picture of those three comments on your Basecamp folder.

- Final Deliverable: You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required fixes from the professor or TA. Fix your code and edit your original Basecamp post with the words "FINAL TURN IN".

## Requirements

- ALL THE REQUIRMENTS FROM PROJECT 1 STILL APPLY!

- One valid, error-free CSS file with your original code; and one file containing the CSS reset code you used. Both linked from the head of all three HTML files

- Apply at least five of the same style elements to each of your pages. Example removing the list-style from navigation on all three pages with a single CSS deceleration.

- Apply at least five different style elements to each of your pages.

- Centered horizontal-navigation. At the top of and identical on every page.

- Use one imported font style and one browser native font style.

- Six screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for each website page. Use the live link to validate. (-50% if it doesn't validate)

- Your HTML and CSS files should both be indented with 2 spaces per level of indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all rules and blocks inside your media queries

- You must use relative units (em, rem, vm, %) in your CSS to make your pages fluid. You may use px units to put a maximum size or within content areas.

- Create at least one fluid layout page using relative units (em, rem, vm, %) and one fixed width layout page.

- A subjective grade will be applied to websites that are not creative and just apply the minimum required style.
